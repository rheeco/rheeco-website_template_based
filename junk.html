            I am a General Engineer from Harvey Mudd College (Class of 2013)
            and I have previously worked in Patent Law as a Patent Engineer
            before my current position as a Bioinformatics Software Engineer
            at a genomic startup in Silicon Valley.  My interests include many
            different fields including image processing, bioengineering, and
            Patent Law.
            <br>
            Outside of work, I have a few activities I enjoy including hiking,
            swimming, drawing, playing the guitar, driving, reading, catching up
            with friends, traveling (and taking landscape photographs) and
            coding up various side projects.
            <br>
            I am currently reading The Road to Character by David Brooks and
            some previous books I would recommend include, at the very least,
            Born to Run by Christopher McDougall.
