            I am a General Engineer from Harvey Mudd College (Class of 2013)
            and I have previously worked in Patent Law as a Patent Engineer
            before my current position as a Bioinformatics Software Engineer
            at a genomic startup in Silicon Valley.  My interests include many
            different fields including image processing, bioengineering, and
            Patent Law.
            <br>
            Outside of work, I have a few activities I enjoy including hiking,
            swimming, drawing, playing the guitar, driving, reading, catching up
            with friends, traveling (and taking landscape photographs) and
            coding up various side projects.
            <br>
            I am currently reading The Road to Character by David Brooks and
            some previous books I would recommend include, at the very least,
            Born to Run by Christopher McDougall.

            <li>Discussions heavy in scientific technical details benefit from
                very simple but straightforward data presentation and visuals
                and so I've always had an interest in developing skills used
                by Front-End Developers to facilitate those types of
                discussions.  Working on a personal website has been a fun way
                to do so!
            </li>
            <li>I've been taking online tutorials to teach and to familiarize
                myself with HTML and CSS and, eventually, will learn more
                about JavaScript.
            </li>
            <li>Most recently, I've been exploring flexbox and experimenting
                with the layout of the items on my site.  This has all taught
                me that Front-End Developers must be very patient!
            </li>
            <li>I would love feedback if you have any!  I can be reached via
                LinkedIn, linked in the header.

            <h4>3D LED Array | May 2013</h4>
            <li>I took a course called Microprocessor-based Systems in college
                where I designed, built, and tested a utility board including
                a Xilinx Spartan 3 FPGA, a PIC microcontroller, configuration
                PROM, LEDs, switches, and a clock oscillator.  As a final
                project, my lab partner and I designed, built, and tested a
                3D LED array in the form of a skyscraper using the FPGA,
                time-multiplexing, the PIC, the SPI function of the PIC,
                Bluetooth, and image processing via MATLAB.

            <h4>Seam Carving | Dec 2011</h4>
            <li>During college, I discovered that I really enjoyed image
                processing.  After implementing numerous edge detection
                techniques, and various transforms for information
                condensation, manipulation, and analysis in MATLAB (including
                frequency domain filtering, noise-redction algorithms, and
                color manipulation to name a few), I developed a program
                to implement a commercially comparable Seam-carving algorithm
                in MATLAB.  The overall method of carving or adding seams
                is described below:
              <ul>Find the gradient of the image with edge detection (e.g.,
                  Laplace zero)
              </ul>
              <ul>Find potential paths to take in the image (e.g., using the
                  created gradient)
              </ul>
              <ul>Mark the path to add or get rid of
              </ul>
              <ul>Cut or add the path
              </ul>
            </li>
